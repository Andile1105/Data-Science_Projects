# Data Science Projects

This repository contains my personal projects and learning materials for various areas of Data Science. It is organized by specialization to demonstrate hands-on skills and practical experience across the full data workflow, from data engineering to machine learning, analytics, and visualization.

## Structure

- **Data_Engineering/** – Projects focused on building data pipelines, ETL workflows, workflow orchestration (Airflow), Dockerized pipelines, and CI/CD automation.
- **Machine_Learning/** – Projects exploring predictive modeling, classification, regression, and NLP using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- **Data_Analytics/** – Projects highlighting data exploration, analysis, and business intelligence, including dashboards and KPI reports using SQL, PowerBI, or Python.
- **Data_Visualization/** – Projects emphasizing clear and effective visualization of data insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or Tableau.
- **AI_Deep_Learning/** – Projects focused on deep learning techniques, including computer vision, NLP, and neural network model development.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical skills in data science, provide structured learning paths for different specializations, and serve as a professional portfolio for potential employers or collaborators. Each project includes code, documentation, and instructions to reproduce results.
